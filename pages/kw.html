  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="bold">KitchenWare</span> is the name of Rooftop Media's suite of software tools.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of the "KitchenWare" project is "whatever Rooftop Media needs."  And as Rooftop Media does primariily technology-related business, that means KitchenWare may address issues in a diverse range of <span class="bold">software environments</span>. And, within each of those environments, solutions are needed to handle a diverse <span class="bold">range of technical problems</span>.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in spite of the variety of issues we may face, the KitchenWare strategy is to focus on clear, customizable <i>basic programs</i>, which serve as a stury foundational framework for more specific apps.</div>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below are descriptions of the <span class="bold">3 guidebooks</span> that will describe KitchenWare's foundation.</p><br/>

  <div id="flex-box">
    <div class="left-side">
      <div><span class="bold">Ktty</span> is KitchenWare's first foundational program. </div>
      <div>Ktty is actually 4 programs in one, all made specially for the text-terminal.</div>
      <br/>

      <div>The four programs are:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>A plain text editor.</li>
        <li>A code editor<span class="faded">, with code editor niceties.</span></li>
        <li>A web browser<span class="faded">, which renders html/css.</span></li>
        <li>A web server<span class="faded">, which <i>serves</i> html/css.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <br/>

      <div>The Ktty code tutorial is also on <a href="https://github.com/rooftop-media/ktty-tutorial" target="_blank">Github</a>.</div>
    </div>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div><span class="bold">Ktty</span> is all about making it clear how these programs are built.</div>
  <div>The guidebook, "Making Ktty", explains the code step-by-step, in vanilla NodeJS.</div>
  <br/>

  <div>The Ktty system is a "What You See Is What You Get" system (WYSIWYG), inspired by the classic Model-View-Controller architecture.</div>
  <div>Such terms are part of the classic object-oriented patterns developed in the Smalltalk operating system.</div>
  <br/>

  <div class="faded">This project was inspired, in part, by the 1991 book titled "Inside Smalltalk."</div>
  <div class="faded">Also, I cite "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Code", from 1995.</div>
