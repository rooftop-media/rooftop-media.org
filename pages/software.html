  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="bold">Software</span> is our specialty.  We provide a set of open-source creative productivity apps, like editors for scripts, photos, video, wikis, financial sheets, web pages, publishable print designs, & more. </div>

  <!--  Describing our goals...     -->
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below are two sets of goals we have for our software -- our goals for the completed software <span class="bold">apps</span>, and our goals for the internal design of the <span class="bold">code</span>  for those apps.</p><br/>

      text-align: center;
      width: 48%;

      <div>Our software <b>apps</b> should ...</div>
      <p>...be <b>easy to understand</b>.</p>
      <p>...be <b>efficient to use</b>.</p>
      <p>...serve a <b>practical</b> use.</p>
      <p>...be <b>focused</b> and <b>well-organized</b>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right-side gray-box">
      <div>Our software <b>code</b> should ...</div>
      <p>...have <b>few external dependencies</b>.</p>
      <p>...be built with <b>known patterns</b>.</p>
      <p>...be <b>well documented</b> & <b>justified</b>.</p>
      <p>...be <b>customizable</b>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <br/>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to produce software that meets those goals, we ended up researching & designing a <span class="bold">full software stack</span>, built on our own framework, with nothing but vanilla NodeJS.</p><br/>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've organized our software efforts into <span class="bold">3 layers</span>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the <span class="bold">Applications</span>, which are useful productivity programs.</li>
    <li>the <span class="bold">Framework</span>, which are tools used to make those applications.</li>
    <li>the <span class="bold">Research</span>, which describes underlying software details & principles.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of those layers is described by 3 books, creating a sort of <span class="bold">trilogy-of-trilogies</span>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project, to make these 9 guidebooks and the software that accompanies them, is called <span class="bold">KitchenWare</span>.  The name is inspired by the fine control some experienced chefs have, when equipped with the right kitchen equipment. </p><br/>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below are 9 images, of the covers of the 9 planned KitchenWare guides.  Click on one to jump that guide's summary -- or just keep scrolling. </p><br/>

  <!--  Framework app descriptions -->
  <div class="flex-box">
    <div class="left-side">
      <div><span class="bold">Ktty</span> is KitchenWare's first foundational program. </div>
      <div>Ktty is actually 4 programs in one, all made specially for the text-terminal.</div>
      <br/>

      <div>The four programs are:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>A plain text editor.</li>
        <li>A code editor<span class="faded">, with code editor niceties.</span></li>
        <li>A web browser<span class="faded">, which renders html/css.</span></li>
        <li>A web server<span class="faded">, which <i>serves</i> html/css.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <br/>

      <div>The Ktty code tutorial is also on <a href="https://github.com/rooftop-media/ktty-tutorial" target="_blank">Github</a>.</div>
    </div>

      <img src="/assets/making_ktty_guidebook_cover.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div><span class="bold">Ktty</span> is all about making it clear how these programs are built.</div>
  <div>The guidebook, "Making Ktty", explains the code step-by-step, in vanilla NodeJS.</div>
  <br/>

  <div>The Ktty system is a "What You See Is What You Get" system (WYSIWYG), inspired by the classic Model-View-Controller architecture.</div>
  <div>Such terms are part of the classic object-oriented patterns developed in the Smalltalk operating system.</div>
  <br/>

  <div class="faded">This project was inspired, in part, by the 1991 book titled "Inside Smalltalk."</div>
  <div class="faded">Also, I cite "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Code", from 1995.</div>

  <h2>Making Cookbook</h2>

        <span class="bold">Cookbook</span> is a component-based framework for making website page designs.
      </div>
      <div class="faded">
        The framework is inspired by the features of other popular web-frameworks, like VueJS, Angular, or React.
      </div>
      <br/>

      <div>Cookbook is for designing professional website pages. Features include:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>An object-oriented component system!</li>
        <li>Single file components - <span class="faded">html, css, & js in one.</span></li>
        <li>Use reactive data in html & css.</li>
        <li>Page routing organization options.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>We'll use CookbookJS to make all our app interfaces.  So it's pretty important!</div>
  <div>The guidebook, "Making Cookbook," describes how to write & use Cookbook, for Ktty's web browser as well as standard, GUI browsers, like Chrome or Firefox.</div>

  <h2>Networking & Security Tools</h2>

  <div class="flex-box">
    <div class="left-side">
      <div>
        The final foundational piece of KitchenWare is a series of networking & security tools, which will be used in various apps.
      </div>
      <br/>

      <div>Toolkits will include:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Email protocol tools<span class="faded">, aka SMTP.</span></li>
        <li>Crypto tools.</li>
        <li>Database & hash tools.</li>
        <li>Socket connection tools.</li>
        <li>Other HTTP/TCP tools.</li>
