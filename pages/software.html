  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="bold">KitchenWare</span> is the name of Rooftop Media's suite of software tools. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in spite of the variety of issues we may face, the KitchenWare strategy is to focus on clear, customizable <i>basic programs</i>, which serve as a sturdy foundational framework for more specific apps.</div>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below are descriptions of the <span class="bold">3 guidebooks</span> that will describe KitchenWare's foundation.</p><br/>

  <h2>Making Ktty</h2>
  <hr>

  <div class="flex-box">
    <div class="left-side">
      <div><span class="bold">Ktty</span> is KitchenWare's first foundational program. </div>
      <div>Ktty is actually 4 programs in one, all made specially for the text-terminal.</div>
      <br/>

      <div>The four programs are:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>A plain text editor.</li>
        <li>A code editor<span class="faded">, with code editor niceties.</span></li>
        <li>A web browser<span class="faded">, which renders html/css.</span></li>
        <li>A web server<span class="faded">, which <i>serves</i> html/css.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <br/>

      <div>The Ktty code tutorial is also on <a href="https://github.com/rooftop-media/ktty-tutorial" target="_blank">Github</a>.</div>
    </div>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div><span class="bold">Ktty</span> is all about making it clear how these programs are built.</div>
  <div>The guidebook, "Making Ktty", explains the code step-by-step, in vanilla NodeJS.</div>
  <br/>

  <div>The Ktty system is a "What You See Is What You Get" system (WYSIWYG), inspired by the classic Model-View-Controller architecture.</div>
  <div>Such terms are part of the classic object-oriented patterns developed in the Smalltalk operating system.</div>
  <br/>

  <div class="faded">This project was inspired, in part, by the 1991 book titled "Inside Smalltalk."</div>
  <div class="faded">Also, I cite "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Code", from 1995.</div>
  <br/>

  <h2>Making Cookbook</h2>
  <hr>

  <div class="flex-box">
    <div class="left-side">
      <img src="/assets/making_cookbook_guidebook_cover.png" style="margin-right: 25px;">
    </div>
    <div class="right-side">
      <div>
        <span class="bold">Cookbook</span> is a component-based framework for making website page designs.
      </div>
      <div class="faded">
        The framework is inspired by the features of other popular web-frameworks, like VueJS, Angular, or React.
      </div>
      <br/>

      <div>Cookbook is for designing professional website pages. Features include:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>An object-oriented component system!</li>
        <li>Single file components - <span class="faded">html, css, & js in one.</span></li>
        <li>Use reactive data in html & css.</li>
        <li>Page routing organization options.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>We'll use CookbookJS to make all our app interfaces.  So it's pretty important!</div>
  <div>The guidebook, "Making Cookbook," describes how to write & use Cookbook, for Ktty's web browser as well as standard, GUI browsers, like Chrome or Firefox.</div>
  <br/>

  <h2>Networking & Security Tools</h2>
  <hr>

  <div class="flex-box">
    <div class="left-side">
      <div>
        The final foundational piece of KitchenWare is a series of networking & security tools, which will be used in various apps.
      </div>
      <br/>

      <div>Toolkits will include:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Email protocol tools<span class="faded">, aka SMTP.</span></li>
