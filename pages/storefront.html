  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not enough for a company to have a product â€“ in our case, software & hardware tools. A company must also have a <i>venue</i>, to make such creations available to our community.</div>
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Rooftop Media, we're planning to open a <span class="bold">storefront</span> in the Akron or Cleveland area. <span class="faded">We haven't decided on a location yet!</span></div>
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, the storefront will be open to the public, for anyone to stop in. Customers could browse our products, receive services like paper printing, & consult with our staff about customized production products.</div>
